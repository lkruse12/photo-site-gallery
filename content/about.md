### Me

My Name is Landon Kruse. I graduated from Texas A&M in 2022 with a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering but I've always been interested in the arts. I started this website as a way for me to publicly display all of my favorite photos without creating an instagram photography page. I don't have anything against photography socials, I just get more anxious when I have to think about getting followers and likes on my page. Maybe this is more work, but I enjoy learning new skills.

That's another thing about me, I love to learn new things, maybe to a fault. I have a tendency to pick up as many hobbies as I can fit in my closet (they take up a lot of space) and hardly ever follow through with them. In fact, it's not unlikely that I stop keeping up with this page at some point too. But for now at least, it's here. So please enjoy!

### My First Camera

In Spring of 2021, I was helping my grandparents move out of their old house and came across my grandpa's Canon camera from the 50s. In 1952 he had just graduated from Texas A&M with a bachelor's degree in dairy science when he was drafted into the Army for the Korean war. By the time he made it to Korea though, the active conflict was ending and he was there more as "cleanup crew." He picked up this camera in Japan, as I understood it, before he got to Korea and used it to document his time there.

The fact that the camera was 100% manual fascinated me. Growing up in the 2000s, I only ever knew early digital; film was just something in disposable cameras, and even those had electronics in them. I did a little research, learned the basics of how to use the camera, and shot my first roll of film.

It was terrible. Not surprising for a first ever user of a "real" (non-phone) camera but, not only was the skill missing, the hardware itself needed work. Sitting in a closet for decades in humid central Texas had allowed the lens to fill with moisture which was ruining every image. The camera had come with multiple lenses; 50mm, 85mm, and a 135mm. Each of them had some kind of issue. So I got some very tiny screw drivers and spent hours carefully disecting each one piece by piece while trying to not lose screws smaller than half a grain of rice. I cleaned them up, reassembled them, and then put them back in a closet and forgot about it.

### Rediscovering Film

Fast-forward to Spring 2025. My wife and I are planning a last minute trip to Amsterdam and I came across the Canon in my closet. I decided I wanted to properly learn how to use it this time and take it on vacation to try and get some cool pictures.

So I went to Chat GPT (I know... it's just so easy to ask for some things though) and asked about ISO, aperture, shutter speed, pushing and pulling, exposure values, focal lengths, and everything in between. I also realized that I didn't actually know what the exact model of my camera was either. After some old-fashioned Google searching, I found this [website](https://flynngraphics.ca/model-finder/) which helped me to identify my camera as a Canon Model II D1 and provided me with the original user's guide!

Armed with this new knowledge, and a light meter app, I ordered a few rolls of Kodak gold and started practicing. I shot the first roll around Houston to make sure I knew what I was doing, and then packed up my camera for Amsterdam.

Since then, I've collected a few more film cameras from various family members. My collection now includes a Canon AE-1, AE-1 Program, and an Olympus OM-1N, along with the Model II D1. Recently, I've favored the Program, but I still appreciate the full manual aspect of the II D1 which really helped me learn the basics of photography.

### Future

I'll be updating this site as I add more photos here along my photography journey. Currently, I'm looking into getting my first real digital camera (expensive).

This is also a bit of an experiment in website design, so there will likely be issues along the way. I plan to incrementally improve this site by adding more features, pages, etc. as I learn more.
